## Visitors data
```bash
▶kubectl exec devops-python-app-0 -- cat /proj/data/visitors

▶kubectl exec devops-python-app-1 -- cat /proj/data/visitors
3
```

The data varies for each pod as they have their own persistence. These values are also retained even if the pods are restarted.

## Explain why ordering guarantees are unnecessary for your app
The ordering guarantees are not required for the application because there is no dependency or separation of concerns between the pods. All the pods perform the same tasks, so the order in which they execute does not matter.

## Implementation of parallel launch and terminate
`podManagementPolicy: Parallel`
